Follow these steps to create a detailed plan for implementing the user's request:
1. Read the relevant files/code to understand how the system currently works.
2. Ask questions about the request to clarify any ambiguities and to gather more details.
3. Read project_architecture_and_conventions.md to understand the coding conventions and architecture of the project.
4. Create an aptly named plan.md file in the /Plans/ directory.
5. Create a todo list that breaks down the implementation into manageable tasks.
6. For each task, provide a brief description of what needs to be done and any relevant details. 
7. Show the plan to the user. Wait for their approval. If the user requests changes, go through steps 1-6 again. Only if the user approves the plan, proceed to implementation.
8. Once the plan is approved, proceed to implement the tasks one by one, following the coding conventions and architecture guidelines. Check off each task in the plan.md file as you complete it.
